## Hey, I'm Frank 👋

Software Engineering student at UNC Charlotte (graduating Summer 2026) and freelance web developer. I build full-stack applications with React, TypeScript, and Node.js — including a fantasy baseball platform serving 5,000+ active users.

Currently interested in AI integration, real-time systems, and shipping software people actually use.
